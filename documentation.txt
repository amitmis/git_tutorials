Postgres
Postgres comes with default user: postgres with superadmin priveleges

We need to create the database and make changes in the setting file

git restore --staged file_name  # this is used to remove from the staging area i.e similar to unadding the file

git reset commit_hash_id # this will remove all the commits after this commit id, i.e file content will remain same just they will be uncommitted basically it unstaged

git stash  # this will unadd and uncommit the file, remove the file from the staging are, it will change the content of the file

git stash pop # this will bring back those changes and are ready for commit and add

git remote add origin url # this will add the new url, origin is the name of this url

git remote -v # this will list all the url attached to the folder

git push origin master # this will add files in orgin url and master branch

git branch branch_name # this will create new branch

fork # it is used to create the copy of the project on your own account

git checkout branch_name # the head will come to the new branch

git fetch --all --prune # fetch all commits i.e. from all branches and prune means those deleted will also be fetched

git pull upstream main # it pulls all the changes from main branch

git rebase -i commit_hash # i for interactive mode this will combine multiple commits into one.
